## License of media (textures and sounds)
No non-free licenses are used anywhere.

The textures, unless otherwise noted, are based on the Pixel Perfection resource
pack for Minecraft 1.11, authored by XSSheep. Most textures are verbatim copies,
while some textures have been changed or redone from scratch. The glazed
terracotta textures have been created by
[MysticTempest](https://github.com/MysticTempest).
